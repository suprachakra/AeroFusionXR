# AI Governance Maturity Model Framework

## Executive Summary

This framework establishes a comprehensive 5-level maturity model across 8 critical dimensions of AI governance, providing automated assessment, real-time monitoring, and continuous improvement capabilities. It integrates seamlessly with AeroFusionXR's advanced governance systems to provide stakeholder-specific insights and drive systematic governance evolution.

This integration approach ensures that your sophisticated Pillar 1 maturity model becomes the **central nervous system** for AeroFusionXR's governance, providing real-time visibility and continuous improvement across all advanced capabilities.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the dashboard and scoring systems, or would you prefer to review the remaining 14 pillars first to ensure optimal integration architecture?
