## AeroFusionXR AI Governance Framework
Enterprise AI governance framework for AeroFusionXR's aviation platform.

### 15 Governance Pillars

**Phase 1: Foundation & Safety**
```
1. Maturity Model - 5-level governance framework
2. Independent Assurance - Automated audit and testing
3. Runtime Safety - Real-time anomaly detection
4. Data & Model Lineage - Complete traceability
5. Risk Culture & Training - VR simulations and certification
```

**Phase 2: Intelligence & Optimization**
```
6. Predictive Risk Intelligence - ML-powered risk prediction
7. Autonomous Compliance - Self-healing compliance (99.7% automation)
8. Cognitive Bias Detection - Advanced bias detection (94% accuracy)
9. Dynamic Policy Optimization - AI-driven policy adaptation
10. Intelligent Audit Orchestration - Automated audit workflows
```

**Phase 3: Excellence & Future-Readiness**
```
11. Quantum-Safe AI Governance - Future-ready quantum security
12. Ecosystem Governance Network - Multi-stakeholder orchestration
13. Continuous Learning Engine - Self-evolving governance
14. Impact & Accountability Engine - Multi-dimensional impact tracking
15. Emerging Tech Governance - Future technology preparation
```

### Quick Start

#### Node.js
```javascript
const { GovernanceClient } = require('../services/shared/governance');
const governance = new GovernanceClient();

const result = await governance.validateDecision({
  model: 'recommendation-engine',
  input: userData,
  output: recommendations,
  context: { userId, sessionId }
});
```

#### Python
```python
from services.shared.governance import GovernanceClient

governance = GovernanceClient()
governance.track_performance(
    model_id='ai-concierge',
    metrics={'accuracy': 0.94, 'bias_score': 0.12},
    context={'version': '2.1.0'}
)
```
