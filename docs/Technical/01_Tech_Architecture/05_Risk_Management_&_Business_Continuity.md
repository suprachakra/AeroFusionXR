### Identified Risks & Mitigation

#### Technical Risks

**Risk: Large-Scale Service Outage**
- **Probability**: Low (2% annually)
- **Impact**: High ($1M+ revenue loss)
- **Mitigation**: Multi-region deployment, automated failover, chaos engineering
- **Recovery**: <5 minutes automated recovery, <15 minutes manual intervention

**Risk: Data Breach**
- **Probability**: Medium (industry average)
- **Impact**: Critical (regulatory fines, reputation damage)
- **Mitigation**: Zero-trust security, encryption, continuous monitoring
- **Response**: Automated containment, 24/7 SOC, incident response team

**Risk: Third-Party Integration Failure**
- **Probability**: Medium (monthly minor failures)
- **Impact**: Medium (service degradation)
- **Mitigation**: Multiple data sources, circuit breakers, graceful degradation
- **Recovery**: Automatic fallback to backup providers

#### Business Risks

**Risk: Regulatory Changes (Aviation/Data Privacy)**
- **Probability**: High (annual updates)
- **Impact**: Medium (compliance costs)
- **Mitigation**: Dedicated compliance team, automated compliance monitoring
- **Response**: 30-day implementation timeline for regulatory changes

**Risk: Market Competition**
- **Probability**: High (continuous)
- **Impact**: Medium (market share pressure)
- **Mitigation**: Continuous innovation, patent portfolio, customer lock-in
- **Response**: Accelerated feature development, competitive pricing

### Disaster Recovery Plan

#### RTO/RPO Targets
- **Critical Services**: RTO <5 minutes, RPO <1 minute
- **Standard Services**: RTO <15 minutes, RPO <5 minutes
- **Non-Critical Services**: RTO <1 hour, RPO <15 minutes

#### Recovery Procedures
1. **Automated Failover**: DNS, load balancer, database replication
2. **Manual Intervention**: Complex scenarios requiring human decision
3. **Communication**: Automated status page updates, stakeholder notifications
4. **Post-Incident**: Root cause analysis, improvement implementation
