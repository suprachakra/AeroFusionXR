### 1. Threat Modeling & Loophole Audit

* **Asset Inventory**: GenAI APIs, AR runtime endpoints, Loyalty services, user PII stores, edge kiosks, compliance dashboards.

* **Top Threat Scenarios & Controls**:

  | Threat Scenario   | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation & Contingency                                            |
  | ----------------- | ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Data Exfiltration | High       | High   | Critical | mTLS, WAF, Anomaly detection; Contingency: key rotation             |
  | Model Poisoning   | Medium     | High   | High     | Signed training data, differential privacy; forensic audit          |
  | AR Spoofing       | Low        | Medium | Medium   | Signed anchor payloads, beacon tamper alerts; fallback minimal path |

### 2. Regulatory Checkpoints & Integration

| Regulation    | Requirement                          | Owner & Artifact            | Review Cadence | Delivery Timeline   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| GDPR          | Consent, Erasure, Portability        | `data_governance.md` (DPO)  | Quarterly      | Procedures by M3    |
| PDPL (UAE)    | Data residency, cross-border control | Compliance Matrix (Legal)   | Semi-Annual    | Controls by M4      |
| XRSI          | XR device safety & privacy           | Device Spec (Eng Lead)      | Annual         | Certification by M5 |
| PCI-DSS       | Secure payment in AR Commerce        | Payments Arch Doc (CISO)    | Quarterly Scan | Audit Report by M6  |
| ISO/IEC 27001 | ISMS implementation & renewal        | Security Policy (ISO Owner) | Annual Audit   | Renewal by M6       |

### 3. Enterprise Risk Management & Contingencies

* **Risk Register (SVP Data Sign-off)**:

  1. **Model Hallucinations** → Guardrails, human-in-loop audits, auto‑retrain triggers.
  2. **Edge Node Compromise** → Hardware attestation, patch management.
  3. **UI Vulnerabilities** → SAST/DAST, CSP enforcement.
* **Governance Mechanisms**:

  * Monthly Risk Committee with 24h escalation SLA.
  * Quarterly Incident Simulations and Contingency Playbooks.
  * Annual External Audits and Post-Mortem Reviews.
