### 3. Gap Analysis & Detailed Mitigation

* **DPIA Backlog** → Accelerate workshops with business units; designate two additional data stewards.
* **Documentation Latency** → Automate doc generation via CI; schedule monthly doc sprints.
* **Tooling Gaps** → Evaluate vendor bias-scan SaaS vs. open-source; decision by M3.

*Review Cadence: Internal bi-annual audits & external annual assessments.*
