## 🛡️ **Security Best Practices**

### For Developers
- Always use HTTPS for API communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement rate limiting and request throttling
- Store secrets in environment variables, not in code
- Regularly update dependencies
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### For Infrastructure
- Use AWS IAM roles and least privilege principles
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for audit logging
- Implement network segmentation and security groups
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security scanning and penetration testing
- Monitor for security events and anomalies

### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Keep applications updated to the latest version
- Report suspicious activities immediately
- Don't share credentials or access tokens

- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: OWASP ZAP, Nuclei
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Snyk, GitHub Security Advisories
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Clair
- **Infrastructure as Code Scanning**: Checkov, tfsec

### Regular Security Assessments
- Monthly automated vulnerability scans
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual third-party security audits
- Continuous security monitoring
